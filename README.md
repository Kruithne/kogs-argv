## What is `@kogs`?
`@kogs` is a collection of packages that I've written to consolidate the code I often reuse across my projects with the following goals in mind:

- Consistent API.
- Minimal dependencies.
- Full TypeScript definitions.
- Avoid feature creep.
- ES6+ syntax.

All of the packages in the `@kogs` collection can be found [on npm under the `@kogs` scope.](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/kogs/packages)
